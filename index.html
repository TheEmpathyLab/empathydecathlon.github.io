<h2 id="energy">1. Energy</h2>
<img src="images/energy.png" width="200" height="200" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>Energy is our capacity to take on life's experiences.</h3>
    <p>You can only put energy into something IF you have energy to give. This first skill focuses on identifying what energy is to you, how it is depleted, and ways to build and protect personal energy. How can you share energy if you have none to start off with. If you have plenty of energy, how do you want to spend it?
</p>
<p class="big">Example practices</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about the different type of Energy.</li>
  <li>Make a list of what brings you Energy.</li>
  <li>Practice checking in with your Energy daily.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dashed">
<h2 id="baggage">2. Baggage</h2>
<img src="images/baggage.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>Baggage are life's weights that we take on as we live.</h3>
    <p>Baggage isn’t just a heavy backpack. It’s a heavy heart, heavy mind, and heavy soul. Some baggage is around from lessons learned while other baggage is around because we are too stubborn to discard it / be at peace with it. If you don’t get  to know your baggage, how can you deal with it?
</p>
<p class="big">Example practices</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about the different type of Baggage.</li>
  <li>Make a list of things that weigh you down.</li>
  <li>Practice checking in with your Baggage daily.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="dashed">

    <h2 id="selfawareness">3. Self Awareness</h2>
    <img src="images/selfawareness.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>Knowing where you are helps you identify how you can show up.</h3>
    <p>Self awareness explores the inner workings of ourselves. Being aware takes no sides, it’s an unbiased view of who we are, what pushes us, what pulls us, and how certain events make us feel. This the first attempt at listening to ourselves.</p>
    <p class="big">Example practices</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about the depths of self-awareness.</li>
      <li>Do the fives senses check in and make note of what you sensed.</li>
      <li>Practice focusing on a single sense when alone.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="dashed">

    <h2 id="inventory">4. Inventory</h2>
    <img src="images/inventory.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>Inventory is intentional pause that makes space for self reflection so that you figure out how you are really doing.</h3>
    <p>This is the penultimate step before Hearing. Here we will assess where we’ve been, where we are going, and most importantly, what potential distractions are about. Where’s your energy, what baggage are you carrying, and are you aware of yourself at this moment? Can you listen?</p>
    <p class="big">Example practices</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about the power of pausing to take Inventory.</li>
      <li>Make a Inventory list of your Energy, Baggage, and Self Awareness.</li>
      <li>Practice pausing to reflect between meetings.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr class="dashed">

    <h2 id="hearing">5. Hearing</h2>
    <img src="images/hearing.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>Learn your distractions and how to set them aside so that you can really hear others.</h3>
    <p>Skills 1-4 have prepared us to let the world in. It’s difficult to hear another person if we are low on energy, consumed with our own baggage, or just not self aware enough to hear. It's even hard to listen to someone we disagree with. By preparing ourselves to listen, we open ourselves to connection. Mouth shut, ears open, eyes focused, and experience the other person.
</p>
<p class="big">Example practices</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about what happens when we listen to others.</li>
  <li>Create a list of things that distract you from Hearing others.</li>
  <li>Practice not being distracted by the things on your list.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="dashed">

    <h2 id="responding">6. Responding</h2>
    <img src="images/responding.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>You've recorded their story to your brain, now share back what you've heard.</h3>
    <p>This is when you open your mind and share what you’ve heard.  You are not a critic or supporter, you are a story listener. It is easy to fall into the trap of listening to respond. Here, we will learn to listen, take notes, and be as present with the other person as possible. Our job is to repeat back what they said and gain clarity so that we understand them.
</p>
<p class="big">Example practices</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn what it means to be heard and examine how you feel when you're heard.</li>
  <li>Exercise - listen to a story and try to share it back without your personal opinion.</li>
  <li>Practice responding only to the things that you've heard and let the silence  direct the conversation.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="dashed">

    <h2 id="asking">7. Asking</h2>
    <img src="images/asking.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>Questions to help fill gaps in order to gain a better understanding.</h3>
    <p>You’ve listened. You’ve shared back what you heard. Now, with your notes, here is where we learn how to deepen the things we hear. Gain clarity and understand how they got to their story by asking questions that fill gaps and focus the conversation.
</p>
<p class="big">Example practices</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about open ended questions, opinated questions, and how to ask for more details.</li>
  <li>Exercise - based on what you heard, write down the questions you want to ask before asking them and determine if they are story opening or story closing.</li>
  <li>Practice asking a specific open ended question in your next conversation.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="dashed">

    <h2 id="meaning">8. Meaning</h2>
    <img src="images/meaning.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>This is a time to pause, reflect, and assess if what we are hearing and interpreting is accurate.</h3>
    <p>“This is what I heard, am I hearing you, understanding you correctly?” This is similar to skill #4, Inventory. Here we deal with multiple people, including yourself. We listen to our internal response, how do we feel about what we heard and why? How can we collaborate and give this person or group feedback so that we can move forward with as little ego as possible?</p>
    <hr class="dashed">
    <p class="big">Example practices</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about how to make sense of a story's direction.</li>
      <li>Collaborate on a list of details that make up the story and collective direction</li>
      <li>Practice pausing in meeting and restating what you heard to the group.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="feedback">9. Feedback</h2>
    <img src="images/feedback.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>Move forward with together with a more focused understanding of where you're going.</h3>
    <p>Here is where we start to move forward together. We will cover how to best support what was heard and how to utilize critique in order to reshape possibly redirect what was understood. This is where feelings can get raw and the experience can truly get uncomfortable. Time, space, kindness, and a mutual agreed upon trust is critical to maintain here.
</p>
<p class="big">Example practices</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about your position of priviledge might influence how the Feedback is given and heard</li>
  <li>Make a list how you want to recieve Feedback.</li>
  <li>Create a team guide for how everyone wants to get Feedback.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="dashed">

    <h2 id="lead">10. Lead</h2>
    <img src="images/lead.png" width="150" height="150" class="thumbnail">
    <h3>To lead is to make space for <u>everyone</u> so that they can be their best and support themself and each other.</h3>
    <p>Many people want to be a leader, but few people are prepared to lead. Here we talk about how leadership works in support of all previous skills while at the same time, has a dedicated practice to the fundamentals as well.
</p>
<p class="big">Example practices</p>
<ul>
  <li>As a team, talk about what empathetic leadership looks like</li>
  <li>Create a document that states how Leaders lead with empathy in your company</li>
  <li>Practice checking in with all members of the community frequently on their Empathy Decathlon practice.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
<p>We believe in the power of practicing small foundational skills in order to bring about progressive change. We also believe in the power of practicing with a diverse community of people. By practicing the skills that make up the Empathy Decathlon with a community of people, we hold each other accountable for the change we all desire.</p>
