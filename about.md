Empathy Lab is a experiment dedicated to the study of individual human experiences. By sitting down virtually or in-person with another beautiful human, we create an environment where stories can be exchanged, understanding can be gathered, anonymous vitriol is impossible, and feelings can be shared. By having these conversations, we improve our social awareness and empathy for different people.

Empathy Lab can only thrive if you [share your stories](http://www.empathylab.io/share). The stories that seem to shape us are a mixture of a few grand tales, several tragedies, weird family gatherings, and many, many boring routines. This rich mix is us.
